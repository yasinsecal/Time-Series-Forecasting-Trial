# Time-Series-Forecasting-Trial
- It is my first Time Series Forecast Project.
- I used "Air Passengers". Please find it in "AirPassengers.csv" file.
- To detect seasonality and trends I used both "rolling statistics" and "Dickey-Fuller test". 
- I tried some smoothing methods to eliminate both trend and seasonality, which are "Moving Average", "Exponential Moving Average",and "Decomposing" 
- I used "Differencing Method" for eliminating the trends and seasonality, and as forecast method ARIMA is used.
- Lastly, I got forecast data similar to original one.
